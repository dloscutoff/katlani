    1   ano

## Powers of ten

    10    kib
    100   kid
    1k    kik
    10k   kin
    1m    kot
    1b    kol
    1t    kos
    1q    kon

Numbers are formed with a number of pairs of a digit and power of ten. For example, `24096` is:

    ino kin iko kik aro kib ito

On its own, `ino` is `2`, but `ino kik` is `2000`. On their own, powers of ten like `kik` also work as numbers.

You can use the ordinal particle, `ry`, to add a "th" to the number, making it an adjective. For example, `ry ato` is "fifth", `ry ifo kid` if "eight hundredth", `ry ano` is "first", and `ry kon` is "one quadrillionth".
