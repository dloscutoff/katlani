# Reference Grammar of Katlani

## Phonology

### Consonants

|                    | Labial | Alveolar | Post-alveolar | Velar | Glottal
|--------------------|--------|----------|---------------|-------|--------
| Nasal              | m      | n
| Unvoiced stop      | p      | t        |               | k
| Voiced stop        | b      | d        |               | g
| Unvoiced fricative | f      | s        | ʃ             |       | h
| Voiced fricative   | v      | z
| Liquid             |        | l
| Rhotic             |        | r

For ASCII compatibility, /ʃ/ is written as **sh**.

### Vowels

|      | Front | Unspecified | Back
|------|-------|-------------|-----
| High | i, y  |             | u
| Mid  |       |             | o
| Low  |       | a

The vowels /o/, /u/, and /y/ are rounded; /i/ and /a/ are unrounded.

### Allophony

- /f/ may be rendered as [ɸ]
- /v/ may be rendered as [β] or [ʋ]
- /ʃ/ may be rendered as [ɕ]
- /h/ may be rendered as [ɦ], [χ] or [x]
- /r/ is very flexible in pronunciation; options include [r], [ɾ], [ɹ], [ɻ], [ʀ], [ʁ], and [w]
- /a/ is unspecified for backness; options include [a], [ɐ], and [ɑ]
- A high vowel adjacent to another vowel may be pronounced as a semivowel: /u/ as /w/, /i/ as /j/, /y/ as /ɥ/

### Syllabification and phonotactics

Katlani is quite free in what constitutes a syllable, and many words can be syllabified in multiple ways according to the reader's preference. For example, **onion**, "opinion," can be pronounced as /o.ni.on/, /o.njon/, or /on.jon/.

The majority of words consist of syllables with a maximal structure of CVC; however, some words are quite consonant-heavy. Arbitrary numbers of consonants may be pronounced as part of the same syllable according to individual preference: **kivsk**, "parent," may be pronounced /kivsk/, for example. Alternately, one or more schwas may be inserted to aid pronunciation: /kiv.sək/, /ki.vəsk/, and /ki.və.sək/ are all possible pronunciations of **kivsk**.

Runs of vowels also occur, although not as frequently as runs of consonants. Pronunciation strategies include turning high vowels into semivowels or adding glottal stops. For instance, **abail**, "house," could be pronounced /a.ba.il/, /a.bajl/, or /a.ba.ʔil/.

Stress is not phonologically significant in Katlani.

## Morphology

Katlani is a strongly analytic language, with only one inflectional affix and a handful of derivational affixes.

### Inflectional morphology

The suffix **-i** can be attached to nouns, adjectives, and sometimes interjections. When attached to a noun, it makes the noun plural: **ktaf**, "a book," becomes **ktafi**, "books." When attached to an adjective or interjection, it acts as an intensifier: **fos**, "good," becomes **fosi**, "very good."

The **-i** suffix can be doubled to **-ii**. Applied to a noun, this means "many": **ktafii**, "lots of books." Applied to an adjective, it intensifies even more than **-i**: **fosii**, "extremely good." The suffix may drawn out even further for greater emphasis.

To avoid confusion, nouns and adjectives usually do not end with **i** in their uninflected form.

### Derivational morphology

No derivational morphology has been officially agreed upon, but a few derivational affixes can be inferred from the current vocabulary list:

- **-il** (added to nouns): -ish, -like (**baka**, "fool, idiot," becomes **bakil**, "foolish")
- **-ish** (added to verbs): direct object of the verb (**ktom**, "eat," becomes **ktomish**, "food")
- **no-**: not, un-, opposite of (**poi**, "happy," becomes **nopoi**, "unhappy")

Compounding two words is also possible, though uncommon. The language's name, **katlani**, is an example of compounding: **kat**, "(internet) chat," plus **lani**, "words."

## Syntax

### Sentence order

Katlani is mostly head-initial, although its case markers allow for some flexibility.

The default sentence order is verb, subject, object (VSO):

**iz o su dogo**  
bite cat acc dog  
*The cat bites the dog.*

**iz dogo su o**  
bite dog acc cat  
*The dog bites the cat.*

However, sentence components can be fronted for emphasis:

**su o iz dogo**  
acc cat bite dog  
*The dog bites **the cat**.* (or *The cat is bitten by the dog.*)

**lia ma pas fobl nimak su o**  
to I pst give this.person acc cat  
*They gave the cat **to me**.* (lit. *To me they gave the cat.*)

### Verb phrases

Verbs can be marked for *time* using one of three particles, which normally precede the verb:

- **pas** (past time)
- **ni** (present time)
- **fy** (future time)

A verb may also be unmarked for time, in which case its time component is inferred (usually assumed to be present unless there is obvious context that suggests otherwise):

**gus ma su rno**  
like I acc fruit  
*I like fruit.*

**bai, kata maka atirlo**  
goodbye chat you.and.I again  
*Goodbye, we will chat again another time.*
